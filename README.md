# üêøÔ∏è Ratatosk

**Ratatosk** is an-driven C# application based on Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. It leverages event sourcing, CQRS, and snapshotting to manage domain logic and state.

## üöÄ Features
- **Event Sourcing**: Stores all changes to the application state as a sequence of events.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: Separates read and write operations for better performance and scalability.
- **Snapshotting**: Periodically captures the state of aggregates to improve rehydration performance.
- **Pluggable Infrastructure**: Supports multiple storage backends, including in-memory, file-based, and SQL databases.
- **Extensible Core**: Provides a core library with reusable DDD building blocks.

## üß± Project Structure
- **Core**: Contains foundational building blocks like `AggregateRoot`, `DomainEvent`, and utility classes (`Result`, `Maybe`, `Guard`).
- **Domain**: Houses domain-specific logic and aggregates, such as the `Product` aggregate in the catalog domain.
- **Application**: Contains services, command and query handlers, and orchestrates application logic.
- **Infrastructure**: Implements storage solutions, serialization, and external configurations.
- **API**: Provides a minimal API interface for interacting with the application.
